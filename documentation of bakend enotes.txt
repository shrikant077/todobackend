=> package.json created using - "npm init"

=> install express server - "npm i express"

=> intall mongoose - "npm i mongoose" - (it is an abstractionm layer on top of mongo db which helps us in connecting with node js application) - mongoose return promises.

=> "npm i -D nodemon" - add "start" : "nodemon index.js" in package.json under scripts.
then run "npm start" in terminal
